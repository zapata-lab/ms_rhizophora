## This script calculated the total standard error in the covariance matrix 
## estimated from the data in Treemix and also estimates the amount of variance 
## in population relatedness explained by the Treemix model being summarized.
## The script assumes the user is in the directory with the Treemix output files
## and simply requires the stem/prefix name for the output files. Therefore,
## the .cov.gz, .modelcov.gz, and .covse.gz must be present in the working
## directory. Optional: one can specify a second 'v' arguement and then use 
## ' > out.txt' to pipe the stdout to an output file for downstream parsing.
